# Terrarium-Monitoring-System
The topic of my project is a terrarium monitoring system. The goal is to monitor the conditions in the terrarium, and if any of the measured parameters are outside the normal range, a warning should appear on the screen and an email should be sent to a specific person.

The page shows the values of the measured parameters, and depending on their value, the color also changes. If the value is within the normal range, the color is green, if it is close to the limit, the color is orange, and if it is outside the normal range, the color is red. Also it is possible to monitor the value change graphically on the charts.

Equipment: NODEMCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor

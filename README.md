# Terrarium-Monitoring-System
Terrarium Monitoring System is a project created to monitor conditions in a terrarium or similar environment. The system allows terrarium owners to track key parameters that affect the health and well-being of their plants.

The page shows the values of the measured parameters, and depending on their value, the color also changes. If the value is within the normal range, the color is green, if it is close to the limit, the color is orange, and if it is outside the normal range, the color is red. Also it is possible to monitor the value change graphically on the charts.

Equipment: NODEMCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor
